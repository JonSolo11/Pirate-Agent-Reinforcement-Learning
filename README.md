# Pirate-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

This project focused on using provided code to train an AI model using neural networks to navigate a maze. I found a balance between exploration and exploitation as well as incoporating
experience replay to optimize the learning process. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Science is a broad spectrum but in regards to machine learning, the goal is to improve upon human processes in factors like accuracy, speed, and processing data. Although this 
was a simple project that involved solving a maze, the concepts behind it are being applied to many large problems in a variety of industries becoming a very powerful tool. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The first goal is to understand the problem. Defining the problem and the goal of the solution provides clear start and end points to begin the process. Next, research is done to identify
any existing solutions or provide clarity on aspects that need further definition. Once I understand the problem and cleared up any grey areas in my knowledge, I begin to design the solution. 
Once a design is created and approved, the design can be developed. My development process includes testing throughout to identify errors and security risks. Lastly, the code is tested as a complete 
system and implemented. This is a simple run down. I think it's crucial to receive feedback from others throughout and be agile to adapt to changing requirements and apply feedback. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities are to ensure that I am doing no harm to the end user or the organization. It's important to ensure that my systems are accurate and secure. It's crucial in the space
of machine learning that I avoid incorporating bias into the model. It's extrememly important to have a firm grasp of data privacy and ownership, especially as legislation is actively being 
written that changes the landscape of how data is handled. I personally believe it's important to act in the spirit of the law instead of trying to push the boundaries and being forced
to constantly react to the changing landscape. People want control over their data and it's important to be transparent and act in good faith to support the wishes of our end users. This 
not only protects the company from legal matters, it builds trust with our users which is far more valuable than data in the long run.
